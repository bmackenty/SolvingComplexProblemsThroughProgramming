# SolvingComplexProblemsThroughProgramming

Welcome

This repository is for our advanced programming class, targeted for 10th grade students (15 and 16 years old).

For many students, this is their first or second programming class, where they write programs in an IDE, upload changes to a remote server, work with the Linux operating system, MYSQL / MariaDB / sqllite, work with git (a little), and use Python to design and construct a  "real" program.

Students will use these templates as a starting point to build an application. We imagine a business students need to build, with interlocking elements. 

I know there are some security and performance issues here. I often first sacrifice complexity and the "right way" to help students understand the basics and then slowly build more formal, secure (and performant) code. I also try to over-comment code to help beginning programmers understand how things work.

This code assumes a OS X environment: Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python 3.7+. 

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, please email Bill MacKenty, bmackenty@aswarsaw.org or bmackenty@gmail.com, or open an issue.
